Over the past 8 years, a lot has changed at ISL. The engineering team is no exception. What started as a few scrappy hackers is now a top tier software team capable of standing toe-to-toe with the best. Along the way, we've done all of the things that great teams do: we've [built amazing things for our clients](https://isl.co/case-studies/), [contributed to open source projects](https://github.com/istrategylabs), [hosted conferences](http://contrarycon.com/), and [written countless blog posts](https://isl.co/blog/). At a recent team meeting it became apparent that we weren't doing a good enough job sharing code as we would like. It seems that long-form posts made their way to the blog just fine, but dev-centric topics and hard-core code didn't have a home.

Today I'm pleased to announce the launch of `sudo ISL`&#151;the new ISL Engineering blog ([view the source](https://github.com/istrategylabs/sudo)). Here you'll find code snippets, config files, and all other things dev. We'll be publishing early and often, and keeping the length to a minimum. And don't worry, we'll still be writing for the main [ISL Blog](https://isl.co/blog/) as well.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned!

&#151;Joseph Abrahams, VP of Engineering
